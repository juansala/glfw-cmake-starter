# GLFW CMake Starter

This repo contains a simple reusable CMake project structure for building applications that use the GLFW API for OpenGL. At the moment, it builds GLFW internally and requires a copy of the GLFW source library to be in the project root directory to fully build (details provided in instructions below). 

It also comes with a version of GLAD1, which handles loading OpenGL functions based on the platform. The GLAD1 version can be replaced by pulling the desired files from the GLAD1 webserver (more in the instructions).

Tested only on Windows 11 WSL 2 (Ubuntu 22.04).
